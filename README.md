# Technical questions

## 1.How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
a. I approcimatedly spent three days on programming the project. 
b. i have finished the code testing, and only problem i needed to solve is the code performance.

## 2.what was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
```
let  dbObject = Object.assign({},db);
```
This is the latest feature for the javascript es6, which is able to create a new nested object rapidly. And by this way we could easily avoid deep comparison problem.

## 3.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I would like to use the lighthouse chrome plugin and the chrome built-in development tool to track down the performance issue. This is necessary.

## 4.How would you improve the API that you just used?

The API has worked really well. For example, the api for searching by name can be also used by isbn code. This improvement can save tons of hours on frontend logic coding.

## 5.Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON

```

   "firstName":"junjie",
   "lastName":"zhang",
   "email":"stanley158831384@gmail.com",
   "description":"i am a coding enthusiast, and a really technical people. My goal is to be a cloud developer, to achieve this goad i have seriously planed my career. And this is my first step, that is to be frontend developer. So i hope i can get this offer."
